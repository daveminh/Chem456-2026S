Materials from this class were adapted from previous versions of the class and online workshops. Some of these sources may be useful to students of this class.

# History

* In Spring 2020, I taught [Chem 456](https://github.com/daveminh/Chem456-2020S) for the first time. Most of the examples were designed to be run in a computer lab.
* In Summer 2021, I organized [An International Workshop in Modeling Biological Macromolecules](https://ccbatiit.github.io/modelingworkshop2021/index.html) and then ran a small session of Chem 456. Most examples were accessible through a virtual machine.
* In Spring 2022, I organized [another version of the workshop](https://ccbatiit.github.io/modelingworkshop/index.html), this time held in person in Baranquilla, Colombia. Lectures were simultaneously translated into Spanish! Examples were migrated to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), allowing easy access from computer with an internet connection.
* I also taught Chem 456 in [Fall 2022](https://github.com/daveminh/Chem456-2022F) and [Fall 2024](https://github.com/daveminh/Chem456-2024F). There have been some very successful student projects! This semester will be different because we will run Jupyter notebooks on ACCESS-CI resources instead of Google Colab. The interface is very similar, but ACCESS-CI has two key advantages: you will retain your virtual environment so that you don't need to install packages before every exercise; and you can keep notebooks running for two days. It may require a bit more a learning curve in the beginning, but can ease a transition to batch jobs later in the class. Google Colab versions from [Fall 2024](https://github.com/daveminh/Chem456-2024F) may be a useful backup if ACCESS-CI resources are not working.
